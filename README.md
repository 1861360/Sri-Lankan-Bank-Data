Using a real Sri Lankan loan portfolio dataset, the study gained practical insights into borrower behaviour and risk trends, such as high NPL customer and loan categories, discipline shown in lower CRIB ratings. These patterns highlight the value of using real-world data to understand portfolio risk. Further we can use predictive models to identify the strongest drivers of default, helping banks detect high-risk customers early and reduce future loan losses.
